This is Crypt::Rijndael version 0.04, an XS-based implementation of
the newly-selected Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm Rijndael,
designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.

Installing Crypt::Rijndael
--------------------------

The usual:

	1. perl Makefile.PL
	2. make
	3. make test
	4. make install

Notes
-----

This module has been tested successfully on:

Linux 2.2.x (x86)
Linux 2.4.x (x86)
Win95/VC++ (x86)

Perl 5.005_03, 5.004_02

Kindly report any other successful platform/architecture successes.

Caveat Emptor: Note that this has not been tested on anything but
x86, so there may be endian issues.

Tests have been added to reflect tests given in the preliminary draft
FIPS released by NIST on March 2, 2001.

Thanks to Mike Blazer <blazer@mail.nevalink.ru> for fixes involving
Win32 and older Perl version compatibility.
