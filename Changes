	* Adjust version number to match distro number (RT #4227)
	* Use <sys/types.h> instead of hard-coding (RT #22755, 9514, 18812,
	1444, 503).

	* Re-jiggered logic to define UINT32 and UINT8. First I'll try
	sys/types.h, then check if they are already defined elsewhere, and
	lastly hardcode the typedefs based on platform. The previous 
	release (0.06_02) had some problems on Windows from conflicting
	typedefs (similar to the cygwin problems with libjpeg and X), so
	I guard my typedefs by checking for previous definitions. Let's 
	hope those previous definitions are right :)

	* Let's try some hardcoded types for UINT(32|8) for Windows.
