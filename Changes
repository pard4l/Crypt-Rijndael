0.06 - Sun Nov 12 10:38:56 2006
	* Adjust version number to match distro number (RT #4227)
	* Use <sys/types.h> instead of hard-coding (RT #22755, 9514, 18812,
	1444, 503).
	* This module is now maintained by brian d foy (bdfoy@cpan.org)

0.06 - Wed Jan 10 00:35:10 2007
	* Let's try the int type for MinGW:wq

0.06 - Fri Dec 15 08:12:02 2006
	* Updated header file to handle Solaris special case
	* I think this might be the release candidate for 0.07! :)

0.06 - Wed Nov 29 19:51:33 2006
	* Adjusting WIN32 targets for typedefs. Some things look like both
	Unix and Windows, so I don't want compilers to choke if it tries to
	redefine types.

0.06 - Mon Nov 27 10:37:18 2006
	* more header file fiddling to get everyone to define the right
	abstract types. This time check for _SYS_TYPES_H

0.06 - Fri Nov 17 14:56:19 2006
	* Fooled with header file some more, and tested it myself on
	Cygwin. Instead of checking for WIN32, just check for __CYGWIN__

0.06 - Fri Nov 17 11:13:25 2006
	* The last two revisions seem to not define UINTxx and ends up with a
	parse error. Let's try this, as I go off to dig out my Windows box.

0.06 - Wed Nov 15 14:43:37 2006
	* Try UINT patch from David Golden to get this to work on MinGW

0.06 - Wed Nov 15 11:07:08 2006
	* Re-jiggered logic to define UINT32 and UINT8. First I'll try
	sys/types.h, then check if they are already defined elsewhere, and
	lastly hardcode the typedefs based on platform. The previous 
	release (0.06_02) had some problems on Windows from conflicting
	typedefs (similar to the cygwin problems with libjpeg and X), so
	I guard my typedefs by checking for previous definitions. Let's 
	hope those previous definitions are right :)

0.06 - Sun Nov 12 16:23:07 2006
	* Let's try some hardcoded types for UINT(32|8) for Windows.
